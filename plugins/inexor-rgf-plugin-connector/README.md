* Inexor will be a new first-person shooter game which is based on a new octree-based game engine.
* Inexor focuses on classic gameplay as we've seen in Cube2 or the Quake series.
* Inexor will be written from ground up new in C++17 and Rust.
* You can contribute anything you want: code, content, ideas..
* Inexor and all its content is 100% open source!

### About Inexor Reactive Graph Flow

The Inexor Reactive Graph Flow (RGF) manages reactive flows based on a graph database. The main interface is GraphQL.

* Semantic: Graph database with entities and relationships as first class citizens
* Reactive: entities and relationships are/can be reactive: If the input has been altered the entity processes its new state
* Interoperable: Use GraphQL for queries and mutations
* Extendable: Built in type system: components, entity types and relation types
* Memory efficient: Rust
* Fast: Rust
* Secure: Rust

#### User Stories

* As a developer or a flow editor I can connect and disconnect an inbound property of an entity instance with an
  outbound property of another entity instance
* Changes on the inbound property results on changes of the outbound property

#### What is a connector?

A connector connects a property of the outbound entity instance with a property of the inbound entity
instance and propagates the changes of the value.

During propagation a propagation function is called. The propagation function has one single input (the
incoming value). Connectors of different types has different propagation functions.

The propagation function can only do simple things (like casting or logging) but in fact even these
simple operations makes the control flow much simpler and much more readable.

#### How does a connector work?

The connector is a relation instance which connects two entity instances. The relation itself stores
the names of the output property and the input property.

In theory, it's also possible to connect two properties of the same entity instance.

On construction the streams are connected.

On destruction of the connector, the stream will be removed.

---
**Warning**

1. Connecting properties of the same entity instance is discouraged to prevent feedback loops
2. No type checks are performed on construction (yet; you are responsible)
3. There is no check about feedback loops (yet; you are responsible)
4. Renaming the relation properties (outbound_property_name, inbound_property_name) doesn't have any
   effect (yet). You have to remove the old connector and create a new connector.
